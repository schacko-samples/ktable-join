== KStream-KTable join with Json Serde

Input 1: KStream<Integer, Cashflow>
Input 2: KTable<Integer, Contract>

Output: KStream<Integer, MyValueContainer> [See the class MyValueContainer for details]

See the `application.properties` file for how the Serdes are configured.

The main Kafka Streams processor receives the input data and do the join operation. Then it sends the output to another topic.

The main application also contains a test `StreamListener` that receives data from the Kafka Streams processor output.

Clone the repo and build the project:

`./mvnw clean package`

Run the application (IDE or CLI)

This sample assumes that you run Kafka broker on localhost:9092. If that is not the case, change the configuration.

Run the standalone main class `DataPublisher` to publish test data into cashflow and contract.
Then watch the processor application console for the received data.
